This repo roughly follows a [git-flow model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). `master` is the version of code currently published on the chrome web store, while `develop` is the current state of reasonably-stable code (analogous to trunk in the svn world). You should target your pull requests at develop - not master.
  
Try and build modular javascript - while parts of the existing codebase aren't written as modules it's by far the preferred format for new work.
